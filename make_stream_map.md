## Explanation of make_stream_map.py

### Introduction
The `make_stream_map.py` script is designed to create a binary stream network map from an input file in the ERDAS BIL format. It processes the input file to identify stream pixels based on a specified threshold value and generates an output file with the stream network map. Additionally, it modifies the header file associated with the output to ensure compatibility with the generated binary stream network map.

### Functionality

1. **Importing Libraries**: The script begins by importing necessary libraries. `numpy` is imported to handle numerical operations, and `readbilheader` is imported to read spatial parameters from the header file of the input ERDAS BIL file.

2. **make_stream_map Function**:
   - **Reading Spatial Parameters**: The `readbilheader` function is used to read spatial parameters such as rows, columns, byte order, and data format from the header file of the input ERDAS BIL file.
   - **Opening Files**: The script opens the input and output files for reading and writing, respectively.
   - **Initializing Zero Array**: An array `zro` of zeros is initialized with the appropriate shape based on the number of columns in the input file.
   - **Processing Data Rows**:
     - For each row in the input file:
       - The script reads a row of data from the input file.
       - If any element in the row exceeds the specified threshold value (`thr`), it sets the corresponding element in a copy of `zro` to 1. Otherwise, it writes the original `zro` row to the output file.
   - **Closing Files**: The input and output files are closed.
   - **Modifying Header File**: The script modifies the header file associated with the output file to ensure compatibility with the generated binary stream network map. It updates attributes such as `NBITS`, `BANDROWBYTES`, `TOTALROWBYTES`, `PIXELTYPE`, and `NODATA`.
   - **Printing Completion Message**: Upon completion, the script prints a message indicating the successful creation of the binary stream network map.

3. **Main Block**:
   - The main block of the script serves as a test script. It specifies the input file path (`facf`), threshold value (`thr`), and output file path (`strf`), and then calls the `make_stream_map` function with these parameters.

### Conclusion
In summary, the `make_stream_map.py` script reads an input ERDAS BIL file, identifies stream pixels based on a threshold value, generates a binary stream network map, and modifies the associated header file to ensure compatibility. It provides a straightforward solution for creating stream network maps from spatial data.
